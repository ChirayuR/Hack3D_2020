# Warmup Challenges

Before the start of the challenge, participants were given a warmup challenge to test their skills.

### Warmup Challenge 1

 The challenge is simple. You just need to fill in the center row of squares with the correct color. A STEP file of the challenge is provided and can be imported into a CAD program (example: SolidWorks, Inventor, Onshape, Fusion360).
 
 >! It was found that the .STEP file had hidden text inside the part. Upon slicing revealed the colors of the middle row. 
 Also another way to solve this puzzle is to look at number of times each letter appears and the color is decided based on the number of appearances. Example: R is seen 4 times on the grid which corresponds to green, Any character seen twice is of the color blue.
